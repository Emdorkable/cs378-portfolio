			+--------------------+


1. In class, we discussed interrupt handlers, which are pieces of code that are
executed on that receipt of an interrupt.  Where does Pintos define its
interrupt handlers?  What function executes on the receipt of a timer interrupt?



2. What synchronization tool is used to implement a condition variable?  A lock?



3. When a thread blocks in a semaphore, to which blocking queue is it added?



4. What does the comment above thread_block() say?

Threads can be blocked using this function, essentially put to sleep, where they will not be scheduled again
until it is awoken but thread_unblock(). It should be called with interrupts off.

5. thread.h defines a struct thread.  struct thread is analogous to an OS data
structure we studied in class.  Which one?



6. Where are the members of struct thread initialized?



7. What is the difference between thread_init() and init_thread()?



8. In Pintos, there is a timer_ticks variable.  What is its purpose?  Where is
it updated?



9. What data is stored in struct lock? 



i10. How do you find or set a threadâ€™s priority? Why would you want to do that?
