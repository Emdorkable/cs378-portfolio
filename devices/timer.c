@Cosmic
What do I say
bulbasaur â€” Today at 5:37 PM
who is this?
Cosmic â€” Today at 5:46 PM
SAY YES
JUST DO IT
PrinCe_LoGic â€” Today at 5:58 PM
alright, done
so what's the move about food padilla
Cosmic â€” Today at 6:03 PM
I am at a food truck rn 6-6
PrinCe_LoGic â€” Today at 6:03 PM
oh ok nice
what you gettimg
bulbasaur â€” Today at 6:04 PM
oh i forgot to tell yall
but i got one more test working
PrinCe_LoGic â€” Today at 6:05 PM
whoa nice
you're gonna have to catch us up to speed
bulbasaur â€” Today at 6:05 PM
i did like one thing
which is change the while loop statement
Cosmic â€” Today at 6:23 PM
Yeye epic!
Which test does it pass?
Aside from alarm-zero
bulbasaur â€” Today at 6:23 PM
alarm negative
its a temporary solution tho
well kinda
actually its not
Cosmic â€” Today at 6:24 PM
By that you mean we'd most likely keep that change you made?
Bc I might head back go my dorm shortly
bulbasaur â€” Today at 6:25 PM
ahh okay yeah im just sitting at patton hall right now since its so nice outside
Cosmic â€” Today at 6:32 PM
WAIT DANTHY
PrinCe_LoGic â€” Today at 6:53 PM
Iâ€™m eating at kins now
Cosmic â€” Today at 6:57 PM
This might take longer than i expected I'll come over as soon as I'm ready
PrinCe_LoGic â€” Today at 6:57 PM
Wym this might take longer
You been eating
Cosmic â€” Today at 6:57 PM
Im talking w the club people about semester plans T_T 
PrinCe_LoGic â€” Today at 6:58 PM
Quantum collective?
bulbasaur â€” Today at 6:58 PM
yeah she was meeting with them
PrinCe_LoGic â€” Today at 7:00 PM
Yo they had pull pork today
Smacks ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜‹
Cosmic â€” Today at 7:03 PM
Omw!!
Sorry for the lateness ahh
PrinCe_LoGic â€” Today at 7:09 PM
Wya
bulbasaur â€” Today at 7:09 PM
we are walking together
PrinCe_LoGic â€” Today at 7:09 PM
Where at
bulbasaur â€” Today at 7:09 PM
Welch
PrinCe_LoGic â€” Today at 7:10 PM
Tell me when youâ€™re approaching kins:)
bulbasaur â€” Today at 7:10 PM
okay!
bulbasaur â€” Today at 7:18 PM
were here!
